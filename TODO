. Upgrade dotnet from donet 7 to 8 for AOs 2.6
Re-work 'build.py' and leave all the stuff to 'AOs.dev'
. Make AOs launch with windows terminal using from a batch file. (ask the use to change default terminal application from windows console host to windows terminal if windows terminal is installed).
x Add a setup system on first startup of AOs [if aos.user file doesn't exist in 'Files.x72\\root' folder then only open the setup page, also don't ask for password].
Build a search engine which can search for any file, folder or app in your PC like Ueli, Windows search or Apple Spotlight [Not sure if this is going to be a command or a global feature].

x Use "Python.Runtime" module in C# for better connection between C# and Python code.
. Implement a spell-checker (wagner-ficher) algo in AOs error log.
Autocomplete filenames when pressed tab.

There are some bugs in AOs.Parser, fix them. For eg, ">" doesn't work but ">." works. Basically if no argument is passed then ">" won't even be called. Fix it and make it work more better with the new Lexer.
Make AOs' 'ls' command look exactly like bash's 'ls' command doesn.

. For input 'shout "%username%"' this is the output 'SrijanSrivastava'. This is a bug in lexer. Fix it.

. Move all features, history and other things to a json file and read that json file to make implementation and extention of all of these easier.
"settings" command will print all the things from setting.json except cmds.
Refactor the entire AOs.

The "shutdown" command won't shutdown the host machine. Also check if the "restart" commands has the same problem or not.
x Leave 4 spaces in tab when updating files in AOs.dev using "dev" command. (not possible with current System.Text.Json)
When using "dev new" command and the github repo link is asked then clone the repo recursively instead of directly plain cloning.
Improve "AOs.dev"
x Integrate Wikipedia, Play videos on youtube, Cpix and Pixstore in AOs.
x Save Wikipedia, play YouTube videos in 'PowerToys' and access them from the folder using the file_name as command by setting the file to execute description etc in "<command-name>.powertoy" right next to the file you wanna run.
. Remove datetime, random, sysinfo, tree
Fix bug 'start .' doesn't open the current folder and shows a crash error. More in Crashreport.log
. In the 'history' command also show in which session the command was passed just like Instagram's message page where the messeages are seperated by sessions of time and date
Make the 'help <command-name>' page more useful and informational about the command.

Improve help messages, giving more detail about the command - such as how to use - when the input is like `help <command-name>`
Further improve the ';' (run multiple commands in a single line) feature. Make it work like a programming language.
