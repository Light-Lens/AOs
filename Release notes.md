# A brand new entry in the AOs 2 series with a all new command-line experience.
Today, I am excited to announce the release of AOs 2.5! A brand new entry in the AOs 2 series designed two-fold: to be more efficient and powerful, and to be a powerful Developer Tool Built for Developers by a Developer.

## Usage
1. Developer commands:
    The all new `developer` command is designed to help developers develop their apps.

    ```console
    AOs 2023 [Version 2.5]  (User)
    $ dev help
    Type `help <command-name>` for more information on a specific command
    1. new                                                         Create a new project
    2. git, github                                                 Use git to maintain version control
    3. cloc, countlinesofcode                                      Count the lines of code in a project directory
    4. clean                                                       Delete temp/unnecessary files created by the programming language in the project
    5. ver, version                                                Show the current build number of the project
    6. server                                                      Start a local web-server
    ```

2. Encrypt or Decrypt any text:
    Now I introduce a new command, the `filer` command. Designed to encrypt or decrypt text using a very powerful custom text encryption and decryption algorithm with the help of the Absolute Number Disorder (AND) random number generator. I build Filer back in 2021, and was planned to be a part of AOs 1.7 but unfortunately it couldn't be. However, from AOs 2.5, Filer is officially integrated into the powerful environment of AOs.

    Filer could be found on [github](https://github.com/Light-Lens/Filer.git)

    ```console
    AOs 2023 [Version 2.5]  (User)
    $ help filer
    Name:
    filer                                                       A powerful text encryption and decryption program.

    Details:
    filer [OPTIONS]

    Maximum arguments: âˆž
    Minimum arguments: 0

    Options:
    -h, --help                                                  Show help message
    -s                                                          A random seed in the range (0, 1) that acts like a password
    -o                                                          Place the output into <file>
    -m                                                          The maximum length of a string in each chunk
    -t                                                          Text input from the command line
    -f                                                          Takes a text file as an input
    -e                                                          Encrypt the message
    -d                                                          Decrypt the message
    ```

3. Run multiple commands in a single line:
    Save your valuable time by using semicolon `;` execute multiple AOs commands in a single file. This will automatically execute those commands without you waiting for the first one to finish then execute the second manually one-by-one. AOs follows the same multi-line execution conventions as in C#.

    ```console
    AOs 2023 [Version 2.5]  (User)
    $ sfc /scannow; DISM /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
    ```
